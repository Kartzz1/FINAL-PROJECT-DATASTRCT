Working on the Pet Care Management System for my data structure and algorithms project was one of the most challenging experiences I have had so far in college. At first, I felt really stressed and pressured because I was trying to do everything by myself. The project required me to use different data structures like array lists, linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary search trees, and I had to write all the functions manually without using any built-in Java methods. I remember feeling overwhelmed just thinking about how to make everything work together in the system.
When I started coding, I had a hard time organizing my ideas. I wanted the system to be easy to use, but I also had to make sure every function worked correctly. There were times when my code didn’t work and I didn’t know why. I even considered giving up because I was worried I wouldn’t finish on time. Doing a project like this on my own made me realize how much work it takes to build a system that has many parts, like managing grooming services, appointments, medical records, pet queues, and a pet database.
Because I was struggling, I decided to ask my uncle for help. He has some experience in coding and he guided me through the parts I didn’t understand. He showed me how to properly set up linked lists and binary search trees and explained how to make the search functions work better. With his help, I was able to fix mistakes in my code and finally understand how to organize everything. Working with him made the project feel less stressful, and I learned that asking for help is not a weakness—it’s actually a smart way to learn and solve problems faster.
Another thing I found difficult was making the system user-friendly. I had to make sure all the menu options were clear and easy to navigate. At first, it was really hard to combine all the data structures into one system while keeping the code simple and readable. I spent a lot of time testing every function, fixing errors, and making small adjustments. It was tiring, but it was also very satisfying when I finally saw the system working smoothly. I felt proud of myself when I could see the grooming services, appointments, medical records, pet queue, and pet database all working together in one program.
Through this project, I also learned the importance of planning before starting to code. I realized that trying to write code without thinking about the structure first can cause a lot of mistakes. I made flowcharts and simple diagrams to plan how each data structure would work and how data would move through the system. I also tried writing small parts of the code first before putting them into the main system. Doing it step by step helped me stay organized and reduced mistakes.
Overall, this data structure and algorithms project taught me many lessons. I learned how to handle stress and pressure when working alone, how to ask for help when I’m stuck, and how to solve complex problems one step at a time. My coding skills improved, especially in implementing data structures and writing my own functions without relying on built-in methods. Even though it was hard and stressful at times, finishing the project gave me a real sense of achievement and confidence in my abilities as a computer science student.
In conclusion, working on the Pet Care Management System was challenging but very rewarding. I learned the value of patience, persistence, and seeking guidance when I needed it. I feel more prepared now for future projects and more confident in my ability to solve difficult coding problems on my own. This project was stressful, but it was also one of the most meaningful learning experiences I have had in college so far.
